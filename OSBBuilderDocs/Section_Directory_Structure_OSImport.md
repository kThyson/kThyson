# Section: Directory Structure OSImport

The `OSImport/` directory is the initial output location when OS installation media is imported using the `Import-OSMedia` cmdlet. These directories typically contain base images before extensive servicing or customization. Each import operation creates a new subdirectory, allowing users to track and manage multiple imported sources.

# Directory: PEBuilds

**Purpose**: The output directory for customized WinPE images created by the `New-PEBuild` cmdlet. Each PE build gets its own subdirectory, which contains the resulting WinPE image, associated files, and any logs or metadata generated during the build process. This structure allows users to maintain multiple WinPE builds for different architectures, versions, or customization scenarios, and to easily identify and deploy the correct build as needed.

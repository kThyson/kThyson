# Section: Directory Structure Output Artifacts

Output artifacts from OSDBuilder operations are placed in specific directories according to their type:
- Customized OS images: `OSBuilds/`
- Imported OS media: `OSImport/`
- Serviced and updated OS images: `OSMedia/`
- Customized WinPE images: `PEBuilds/`
Each subdirectory contains the resulting images, logs, and metadata for each build or import operation, allowing for easy identification and deployment.

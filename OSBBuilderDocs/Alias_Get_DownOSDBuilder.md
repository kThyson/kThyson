# Alias: Get-DownOSDBuilder

**Alias for:** `Save-OSDBuilderDownload`

This alias provides a convenient way to invoke the `Save-OSDBuilderDownload` function, which is used to download Microsoft Update packages (`.msu` and `.cab` files) for use with OSDBuilder. By using `Get-DownOSDBuilder`, users can quickly initiate update downloads without typing the full function name. This alias is created automatically when the OSDBuilder module is imported, as part of the module's alias setup in the root script. For more information, see the documentation for `Save-OSDBuilderDownload`.

- The use of global variables is extensive and central to how OSDBuilder functions share configuration and state.
- The JSON configuration files provide a way to customize default behaviors without modifying the module scripts directly.
- For persistent or complex issues, consult the full documentation or seek support from the OSDBuilder community.

# Notes

*   This function is fundamental to setting up the OSDBuilder environment. It's usually called automatically by `Get-OSDBuilder` if the environment isn't already configured.
*   The use of global variables is extensive and central to how OSDBuilder functions share configuration and state.
*   The JSON configuration files provide a way to customize default behaviors without modifying the module scripts directly.

# Section: Directory Structure Local Configuration File

The local configuration file, `OSDBuilder.json`, is located in the OSDBuilder home directory (e.g., `C:\OSDBuilder\OSDBuilder.json`). This file stores user-specific or instance-specific default settings for OSDBuilder. Settings in this file typically override those from the global configuration file and the hardcoded defaults in `Initialize-OSDBuilder`. Use this file to persist preferred defaults for paths, feature toggles, and cmdlet parameters without modifying the module scripts directly.

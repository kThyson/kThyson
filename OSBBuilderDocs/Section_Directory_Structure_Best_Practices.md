# Section: Directory Structure Best Practices

**Best Practices:**
- Keep the OSDBuilder directory structure organized and avoid manual changes to subdirectory names.
- Regularly back up the entire OSDBuilder home directory, including all subdirectories and configuration files.
- Use the `OSDBuilder.json` configuration file to persist preferred defaults and avoid modifying module scripts directly.
- Clean up orphaned mount folders and old build artifacts to maintain disk space and organization.

# Section: Directory Structure Key Points

- The OSDBuilder directory structure is crucial for organizing source files, outputs, configurations, and temporary working files.
- Each main directory (Content, ContentPacks, FeatureUpdates, Mount, OSBuilds, OSImport, OSMedia, PEBuilds, Tasks, Templates, Updates) has a specific role in the build and servicing process.
- Understanding this structure is key to effectively using OSDBuilder, as it dictates where input files are sourced and where output artifacts are placed.

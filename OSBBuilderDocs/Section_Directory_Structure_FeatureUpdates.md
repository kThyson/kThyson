# Section: Directory Structure FeatureUpdates

The `FeatureUpdates/` directory stores downloaded Windows Feature Update ESD files (e.g., from VLSC or MSDN) and their expanded contents, which resemble an OS installation source. This directory is used to organize and manage feature updates that can be applied to OS images during servicing or customization.

# Directory: Templates

**Purpose**: Stores JSON task files that function as templates. Templates can be automatically applied during `New-OSBuild` if their naming convention matches certain criteria (e.g., "Global" templates, or templates matching the OS family of the build). This allows for standardized baseline customizations.

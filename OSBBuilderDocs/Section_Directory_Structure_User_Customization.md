# Section: Directory Structure User Customization

Users can customize the OSDBuilder directory structure and settings through the local `OSDBuilder.json` configuration file (located in the OSDBuilder home directory) and the optional global configuration file (located in `$env:ProgramData\OSDeploy\OSDBuilder.json`). These files allow users to set default paths, feature toggles, and cmdlet parameters, providing flexibility and persistence for preferred settings.
